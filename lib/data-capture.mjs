// A session's data capture (#8): the probes the optional inspector seam
// (adapters.inspector) opens, one per pane, and the snapshots taken through
// them. The conductor makes one per boot (lib/server.mjs), bootSession
// calls `seeded` right after each pane's seed and `ready` once both panes
// are up (lib/session.mjs), and the harness asks for more through the API.
// In memory only, dropped with the session.
//
// - seeded (S0): a pane's data before any of the PR's code has run on it;
// - ready (S1): both panes' data once migrations ran and the reviewer is
//   signed in: the baseline. S0 → S1 is the boot span. A pane whose ready
//   read failed keeps its S0, and its first later snapshot is its baseline,
//   so the boot span is never lost;
// - now (Sn): "Snapshot now". The baseline → Sn is the session span. A
//   re-baseline makes now the baseline instead, after a manual sign-in, say:
//   both panes or neither.
//
// An inspector that throws, hangs past limits.timeoutMs or returns nonsense
// never fails the boot or the session: its pane says why it has no data,
// and a call that times out is signalled to stop. An aborted boot calls the
// inspector no more. A late probe is closed unused. Nothing here logs or
// broadcasts a value: onCapture gets the pane, the phase and whether it
// worked, for the boot's two phases only.
