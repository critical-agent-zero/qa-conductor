// Docker Provisioner adapter: the built-in Provisioner that runs each pane as
// containers (a postgres one and an app one) on the host's Docker daemon.
//
// It owns everything docker: the pane pg containers, each pane's network, the
// app containers, registry auth, the one-shot migrate run, the pane env files
// (mode 0600, under workDir), the startup orphan sweep and the failure log
// tails. The conductor core never touches docker. A managed-Postgres or
// process-based deployment provides a peer provisioner; the core and the other
// four seams are identical either way.
//
// The panes are kept apart: each pane's containers join a network of their
// own, so the PR pane's app can neither resolve nor reach the base pane's
// containers, and each pane's database gets a password of its own, drawn per
// boot, which only that pane's DSN carries. The core needs no shared network:
// it reaches the apps through their host ports and the databases through
// `docker exec`.
//
// Single-service per pane: each pane runs its services as `qa-app-<role>`
// with one env file; multi-service docker panes are a follow-up when a
// consumer needs them.
//
// With `internal` (#32), the PR pane's network is internal: no route off
// itself, to the host or to the base pane. A forwarder (lib/forwarder.mjs)
// on an ordinary network, joined to the internal one as `qa-egress`,
// publishes the PR app on the host's loopback and is its only way out: an
// HTTP proxy that lets it out only to the hosts on the allowlist. If any of
// that can't be set up, the PR pane runs as it would without `internal`,
// which is logged, and its isolation verdict is never better than unknown:
// its egress isn't restricted.
//
// Effects are injected (docker wrappers, fsx) so this is unit-tested against a
// recording docker mock with no real containers.
