// A verdict is one of VERDICTS, best to worst:
// - isolated: the Provisioner's check found no way from the PR pane to the
//   base pane, and nothing about the runtime says otherwise;

// - reachable: the PR pane can reach the base pane's containers or ports;
// - shared-host: both panes run as one user on one host (the process
//   Provisioner): there is nothing to check.
// Only `isolated` lets the base pane's changes excuse a PR change.
